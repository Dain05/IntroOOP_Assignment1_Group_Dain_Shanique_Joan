### Description
This program is a simple console application written in C++.  
It simulates an ATM system for XYZ Bank where users can:
1. Check account balance  
2. Deposit money  
3. Withdraw money  
4. Exit the program  

### Features
- Uses a `while` loop and `switch` statement for menu navigation  
- Includes an `Account` class with a private `balance` variable  
- Validates initial balance (must be ≥ 1000 JMD)  
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully  
- Displays confirmation or error messages after each action  

### How to Run
1. Open **MSYS2 UCRT64** terminal  
2. Navigate to the project directory  
   ```bash
   cd /c/Users/Anonymous/Documents/IntroOOP_Assignment1_Group_Dain_Shanique_Joan


### Notes
We tested all options (check balance, deposit, withdraw, exit) to make sure it works properly.  
Each function gave the right output based on user input.
